# Examples

These examples are intentionally small and use **synthetic data** unless stated otherwise. Their purpose is to make GazeAudit's contracts runnable without private eye-tracking files.

## [AOI boundary uncertainty](aoi-boundary/)

Fit `GaussianGazeErrorModel`, define adjacent AOIs, estimate probabilistic membership, and compare hard versus uncertainty-aware assignment.

**Use this when:** you want to understand the measurement-error layer before building a larger analysis.

## [Specification curve](specification-curve/)

Create a synthetic results table, order estimates with `specification_curve()`, calculate `effect_stability()`, and screen factor sensitivity.

**Use this when:** you already have one estimate per defensible analytical specification and want to understand the robustness summaries.

## [Sampling sensitivity](sampling-sensitivity/)

Create a canonical `GazeStudy`, downsample the same participant-by-trial stream to controlled target rates, and evaluate one endpoint with `sampling_sensitivity_curve()`.

**Use this when:** sampling rate is a plausible source of inferential sensitivity.

## Visual convention

Plots in these example pages are explanatory figures. When they display synthetic values, the page and figure say so explicitly. Frozen empirical validation results remain in the [validation matrix](../VALIDATION_MATRIX.html) and case-specific result records.
